# About

[Apache TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/) is an open-source deep learning compiler
stack for CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators. It aims to close the gap
between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance-
or efficiency-oriented hardware backends.

We are excited to announce the 2021 TVM Virtual Conference, December 15-17.
TVMCon will cover the state of the art of deep learning compilation
optimization, with a range of tutorials, research talks, case studies, and
industry presentations. We welcome TVM contributors, users, collaborators, and
researchers, as well as practitioners in machine learning optimization from the
broader community. The conference will discuss recent advances in frameworks,
compilers, systems and architecture support, security, training and hardware
acceleration.

## Call for Proposals

[The 2021 call for proposals is now
open!](https://forms.gle/RbpPfhTSWoWLYWiM9) In early October, the conference
review committee, including members of the Apache TVM Project Management
Committee, will evaluate proposals, with a schedule released in mid to late
October.

## Code of Conduct

- The Apache TVM community adheres to
 the [Apache Software Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).

# TVMCon Partners

Last year the TVM Community organized the third annual Apache TVM Conference as
a fully virtual event. Our goal was to preserve the authenticity of an
in-person event while creating and delivering engaging and thoughtful virtual
content. We welcomed over 1000 registrants from across the world to a three-day
event that hosted over 50 presentations, with every speaker available to engage
with our live audience in active question-and-answer sessions. To date, the
2020 TVM Conference YouTube playlist has had 17,000 unique viewers. This year
we are expanding to a new, advanced virtual event platform, allowing us to
elevate the event beyond content presentations allowing us to bring attendees,
speakers, and sponsors together for an interactive main-event experience. Weâ€™re
confident that the Apache TVM Conference will help sponsors connect directly
with attendees in creative new ways, both during the event and after.

If you're interested in sponsoring the 2021 TVM Conference, please contact
